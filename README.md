# leaflet_challenge

The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, you have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization

Data Visualization
We've utilized the Leaflet library to create an interactive map displaying earthquake locations and details. Markers indicate each earthquake's position based on longitude and latitude, with size representing magnitude and color denoting depth.

Enhanced Interaction
To enrich user experience, pop-up windows provide additional earthquake information upon marker click, promoting deeper engagement with the visualization.

Legend
A legend clarifies the color scheme, aiding users in understanding earthquake depth at a glance.

Our result is a comprehensive earthquake visualization tool, offering intuitive exploration of recent seismic events and enhancing understanding of these geological phenomena.
